Orchid is a modern and well designed distro of Gentoo for PC and Laptop users.

[Version Fran√ßaise](https://github.com/orchid-linux/orchid/blob/main/README.md)

Current version of the project : 1.4 (Alpha : 1.5_dev)

We highly recommend joining our Discord server to be kept up-to-date with the updates, and an overall better support [Orchid Linux](https://discord.gg/Wegk7a6TQ8)

The idea behind this project is to deliver a usable GUI Gentoo install, with modern tools and a sleek design, while providing a fast installation.

Side note, Gentoo isn't recommended for new linux users, but, trying it is an educative experience.

Warning, eventhough this project is deployable and ready-to-use, issues can accure.

Stages4 will be available soon

- GNONE OpenRC and GNOME SystemD
- KDE Plasma
- XFCE

Gaming editions come bundled with 32bits libs, vulkan support, wine, and much more.

We also offer the installation of the [TkG](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg) kernel through our tools.

An installation guide is availible [here](https://github.com/cAptive5976/orchid-reborn/blob/main/INSTALLATION-EN.md).

A documentation page about our tools is availible [here](https://github.com/cAptive5976/orchid-reborn/blob/main/TOOLS-EN.md).

What makes Orchid different from other distros:

- We are not a complete OS per-say, but more of a Gentoo "rice".
- We mostly focus on advanced users, even if the installation is less of a hastle.
- For now, we do not have an install script, nor a graphical installer, the installation is done in CLI (faster and simpler than the default Gentoo experience)
- All Gentoo packages are availible.
- We use the gentoo-kernel-bin Kernel, which follows the LTS channel of linux. Thus making debuging easy and faster.
- `eix` pre-installed.
- LibreWolf and Chromium pre-installed as a binary so you are ready to go ASAP.
- We took the decision to integrate Flatpak by default for practicity raisons
- Snapd is NOT installed

Different archives are availible in the links provided in the installation guide.
